## <u>Using multiple guards</u>

When using the default Laravel auth configuration all of the core methods of this package will work out of the box, no extra configuration required.

However, when using multiple guards they will act like namespaces for your permissions and roles. Meaning every guard has its own set of permissions and roles that can be assigned to their user model.
