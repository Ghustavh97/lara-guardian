# <u>Resetting the Cache</u>

When you use the built-in functions for manipulating roles and permissions, the cache is automatically reset for you, and relations are automatically reloaded for the current model record.

See the [Advanced-Usage/Cache](advanced-usage/cache/cache.md) section of these docs for detailed specifics.

If you need to manually reset the cache for this package, you may use the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan permission:cache-reset
```

Again, it is more efficient to use the API provided by this package, instead of manually clearing the cache.
