# Blade Permissions
This package doesn't add any **permission**-specific Blade directives. 
Instead, use Laravel's native `@can` directive to check if a user has a certain permission.

```php
@can('edit articles')
  //
@endcan
```
or
```php
@if(auth()->user()->can('edit articles') && $some_other_condition)
  //
@endif
```

You can use `@can`, `@cannot`, `@canany`, and `@guest` to test for permission-related access.
