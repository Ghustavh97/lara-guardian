# Using blade directives with multiple guards

You can use all of the blade directives offered by this package by passing in the guard you wish to use as the second argument to the directive:

```php
@role('super-admin', 'admin')
    I am a super-admin!
@else
    I am not a super-admin...
@endrole
```
