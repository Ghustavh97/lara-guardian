# Cache

Role and Permission data are cached to speed up performance.

While we recommend not changing the cache "key" name, if you wish to alter the expiration time you may do so in the `config/larakey.php` file, in the `cache` array.

When you use the built-in functions for manipulating roles and permissions, the cache is automatically reset for you, and relations are automatically reloaded for the current model record:

```php
$user->assignRole('writer');
$user->removeRole('writer');
$user->syncRoles(params);
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
$role->syncPermissions(params);
$permission->assignRole('writer');
$permission->removeRole('writer');
$permission->syncRoles(params);
```

HOWEVER, if you manipulate permission/role data directly in the database instead of calling the supplied methods, then you will not see the changes reflected in the application unless you manually reset the cache.
