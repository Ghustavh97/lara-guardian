# <u>Extending User Models</u>
Laravel's authorization features are available in models which implement the `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\Access\Authorizable` trait. By default Laravel does this in `\App\User` by extending `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User`, in which the trait and `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Access\Authorizable` contract are declared.

If you are creating your own User models and wish Authorization features to be available, you need to implement `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Access\Authorizable` in one of those ways as well.
