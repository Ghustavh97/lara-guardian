### Replacing Role and Permission Models
If you need to REPLACE the existing `Role` or `Permission` models you need to keep the following things in mind:

- Your `Role` model needs to implement the `Oslllo\Larakey\Contracts\Role` contract
- Your `Permission` model needs to implement the `Oslllo\Larakey\Contracts\Permission` contract
